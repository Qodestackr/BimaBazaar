# Policybizaar Kenya: Insurance, Simplified. Digital. Instant.

If a mama mboga in Kawangware must close her stall to chase insurance paperwork, we’ve failed.  
If a matatu owner spends days comparing third-party cover, we’ve failed.  
If a farmer in Nyeri can’t insure crops without a 10-page form, we’ve failed.  
If a tech-savvy Gen Z in Nairobi can’t buy life insurance on their phone during lunch break, we’ve failed.
